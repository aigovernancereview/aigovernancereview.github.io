Under these conditions, AI is the linchpin accelerating and amplifying the\n            development of all fields of research. With the rapid advancement of machine learning in\n            recent years, the governance of artificial intelligence has gradually come under the\n            spotlight. It was once possible to keep track of all the research institutes,\n            conferences and policy developments in artificial intelligence.
